that can be implemented relatively easily to your website through a script.

It is customizable and very light.

TUTORIAL: 



# NOTIFIER:


This is purely for TESTING and EDUCATIONAL purposes.

All information drawn through the Abstract API is handled through ABSTRACT and YOU.

We have no control over anyone's use of our code, and this was made for fun.

In no way should this be used to grab other users' IPs and hold it over them.

It can be used to get a user's IP to IDENTIFY them, or even show who accessed your website.
